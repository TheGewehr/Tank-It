# Tank-It

Hi, the assignement is finally acomplished. 
As you already know, we tryed to implement a vehicle that moved by tracks instead of wheels. But due to the lack of time and the issues we encountered we were not able to achieve 
our objective: The Tank!!!

But we made shure that we do not have a 0 on this assignement:

So that is what you will find in here:

- Gravity, Lift and Drag (some FUYM'ly implemented)
- A bridge made with Hinge constraint
- A loose situation: Being stuck like a turte on his back (in this case on his side, due too the marvellous clipping wheels) witch will force you to restart with the R key
- You can win by getting to the last platform

--> Kinda hard but still fun (The camera spin is made on purpose, it is made to make you feel dizzy, like in real life)

The keys are:

- R to restart
- WASD to moove (only forward movement)
- F1 Debug Mode
- F2 Free Camera
